- 👋 Hi, I’m @Koheeallee-M
- 👀 I’m interested in everything IT. Be it game develpopment, software engineering, data science, database management, cybersecurity, you name it!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and some C and Linux if possible. I already have the basics of C++ down so I'm hoping to transfer those skills over to other languages
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Cyberstorm projects, as I was inspired by a person in the community who gave a talk at the Uni.
- 📫 Reach me by email: koheealleemuhammadali@gmail.com
